\arguments{
\item{df}{data.table}

\item{Q_val}{selection factor. 1/Q sequences pass selection in the thymus. The
default value for mouses 6.27. If a human model is taken and Q is not changed
manually Q = 27 is used}

\item{cores}{number of used cores, 1 by default}

\item{thres_counts}{Only sequences with number of counts above this threshold
are taken into account}

\item{N_neighbors_thres}{Only sequences with number of neighbors above
threshold are used to calculate generation probability}

\item{p_adjust_method}{One of the method from p.adjust from stats package
possible options: "bonferroni", "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "BH" or "fdr",
"BY", "none". "BH" is a default method.}

\item{chain}{Statistical model selection. Possible options: "mouseTRB",
"humanTRB", "humanTRA".}

\item{stats}{Tool that will be used for generation probability calculation.
Possible options: "OLGA", "SONIA". "SONIA" also calculate Q for every sequence.}

\item{model}{Standard OLGA generation probability model is used by default.
To set your one generation probability model write "set_custom_model_VDJ
<path_to_folder_with_model>". Generation probability model is usually IGOR output.
Folder should contain the following files: V_gene_CDR3_anchors.csv,
J_gene_CDR3_anchors.csv, model_marginals.txt, model_params.txt. Some models
one can find in the folder "model"}
}
\value{
Function returns the same table that was in input filtered by number
of counts and number of neighbors with additional columns. Additional columns
are the following
\itemize{
\item{"D"}{"Number of neighbors in clonoset. Neighbor is a similar sequence
with one mismatch"}
\item{"VJ_n_total"}{"Number of unique sequences with given VJ combination"}
\item{"Pgen"}{"Probability to be generated computed by OLGA"}
\item{"Pgen_sum_corr"}{"Sum of Pgen of all sequences similar to the given
with one mismatch"}
\item{"Pgen_by_VJ"}{"Conditional probability. Sum of probabilities to be
generated with given VJ combination"}
\item{"p_val"}{"p value under null hypothesis that number of sequence's
neighbors is not more than in the random model"}
\item{"p_adjust"}{"p value with multiple testing correction"}
}
}
\description{
Main function that takes a table with CDR3 sequences as an input. The table
should have the following columns (Order of the columns are not important but
the following names are necessary)
\itemize{
\item{"Read.count"}{"Number of unique reads per cdr3 sequence"}
\item{"cdr3nt"}{"CDR3 nucleotide sequence"}
\item{"cdr3aa"}{"CDR3 aminoacid sequence"}
\item{"bestVGene"}{"TRBV segment"}
\item{"bestJGene"}{"TRBJ segment"}
}
}
